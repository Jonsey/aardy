The task
Using the Jelly Belly API, build a front-end application that presents a list of jelly beans to the user, with associated images. The design and amount of information to display is completely up to you.

Bonus task(s)
We appreciate that your free time is important. Therefore if you feel your code is unfinished please leave some notes in your README.md explaining what you would do next given more time.

If you want a challenge, try some of these:

Add the ability to sort by name, flavor group, sugar-free status, etc.
Implement filtering by flavor groups (e.g., "Sugar-Free Assorted Flavors", "Superfruit Flavors")
API
Please create documentation for the steps required to run the project.
Jelly Belly API can be found here: https://jellybellywikiapi.onrender.com/api/Beans?pageIndex=1&pageSize=200
API Documentation: https://jelly-belly-wiki.netlify.app/api
Example API response includes jelly bean data with flavor names, descriptions, ingredients, images, and metadata like sugar-free status and flavor groups.
What do we look for?
We will assess the task based on the following criteria:

How clean, modular and extensible the code is
Implementation of NextJS partial prerendering
Proper use of Tailwind CSS for styling
Responsive web design techniques used
Accessibility
Approach to testing
Effective use of AI tools (if applicable)
Anything that goes above and beyond
